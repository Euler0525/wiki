> - Once a problem is described in sufficient detail, its solution is obvious.
> - In theory, theory and practice are the same. In practice, they’re not.
> - If debugging is the process of removing software bugs, then programming must be the process of putting them in.  *– E. W. Dijkstra*
> - Premature optimization is the root of all evil!  *– Donald Knuth*
> - It always takes longer than you expect, even when you take into account Hofstadter’s Law.  *– Hofstadter’s Law*
> - Debugging is twice as hard as writing the code in the first place. Therefore, if you write the code as cleverly as possible, you are, by definition, not smart enough to debug it.  *– Brian Kernighan*
> - Neue Phaenomena zu erklären, dieses macht meine Sorgen aus, und wie froh ist der Forscher, wenn er das so fleissig Gesuche findet, eine Ergötzung wobei das Herz lacht.    *– Carl Wilhelm Scheele*
